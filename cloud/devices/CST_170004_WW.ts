/*
 * LG wall-mounted / built-in IDU, ThinQ model CST_170004_WW, deviceType 401.
 *
 * Seven units on this site across three capacity tiers, which the Wi-Fi module MACs mirror
 * exactly: 1c3929xxxxxx (large), 2028bce5xxxx (medium), 2028bcdcxxxx (small). The LG cloud
 * reports an identical capability set for all seven — same hvac modes, same six fan steps,
 * same 16-30 degC range, supported_features 409 — so one driver covers the tier spread.
 *
 * Same DualCool TLV scheme as RAC / CST_570004, so the protocol handling comes from ac_common.
 *
 * UART header: this family emits async/query frames with header byte6 = 0xa7 rather than 0x87.
 * Our patched tlv_device.ts accepts 0x87 and 0xa7 globally (patch 0001), so upstream's
 * isHeaderByte6() hook is not needed here.
 *
 * HOW THE WIRE VALUES BELOW WERE ESTABLISHED
 * ------------------------------------------
 * Every enum was swept end to end on the 거실바다 unit with bridge mode on, so each step had
 * three independent witnesses that had to agree: the value we asked HA to set, the tag the
 * appliance then reported, and what `lge_thinq` (LG's own decode of the same appliance) read
 * back. A value the appliance silently refuses shows up as "wire unchanged" — which is exactly
 * how three fan speeds stayed broken on the dehumidifier for a while.
 *
 *   mode  cool=0  dry=1  fan_only=2  auto=3         (all four confirmed both directions)
 *   fan   미약풍=1 약풍=2 중풍=4 강풍=6 파워풍=7 자동풍=8    (all six confirmed in cool mode)
 *   0x1fd / 0x1fe are half-degrees: wire 58 = 29.0 degC, wire 36 = 18.0 degC
 *   0x2b3 is watts one-for-one — wire 177 while the cloud reported 177 W
 *
 * That last one is why there is no powerReadXform() here. ac_common's default already passes
 * the raw value through, so nothing needs overriding; the point worth recording is the negative
 * one — RAC's max(5, raw - 60) correction must NOT be inherited, and it is not, because RAC
 * declares it on itself rather than in the base. Applying it here would read ~60 W low.
 *
 * The fan list is mode-dependent on the hardware: in 송풍 (fan_only) the unit rejects 파워풍
 * outright — LG's own cloud command for it was refused too — while all six work in 냉방. That is
 * the appliance's behaviour, not a mapping error, so all six are offered and the appliance is
 * left to refuse what it cannot do, exactly as it does for the LG app.
 */

/*
 * ON POLLING FOR INSTANTANEOUS POWER — measured, and deliberately not done
 * ------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Live power is the main reason for running this appliance locally, and the obvious move is to
 * poll faster than ac_common's 28 s. It was tried and then removed, because the measurement says
 * it buys nothing.
 *
 * The appliance recomputes 0x2b3 on a fixed one-minute cycle and pushes the new value the moment
 * it has it. Sampling at 1 s for five minutes caught five changes, at 43.7 / 60.6 / 60.4 / 60.4 /
 * 60.1 s apart — and **all five arrived as unsolicited two-field pushes**, none as an answer to a
 * query. Polling at 1 s contributed exactly zero readings while publishing ~15 entity updates a
 * second, and would do so on every one of the seven units.
 *
 * The earlier conclusion that this appliance "never pushes power" came from a window in which the
 * unit sat at a steady 408 W: it does not repeat an unchanged value, which looked like silence.
 *
 * (A neighbouring RAC_056905_WW gets a full state frame roughly every 0.4 s. That unit reports ODU
 * telemetry — outdoor air and heat-exchanger temperatures at 0.01 degC, EEV opening — which really
 * does change that often, so its packets are frequent. This multi-split IDU reports none of that.
 * The difference is in what the two units measure, not in how either is being asked.)
 *
 * So ac_common's interval is left alone. It is the backstop for a dropped push, not the path the
 * data normally takes, and the appliance's own 60 s cycle is the ceiling either way.
 */

/*
 * Vertical vane position, 0x321. Positions 1-6 were each set and read back; the continuous-sweep
 * value 100 that other models accept is refused here — the unit coerced it straight back to 4 —

     * 취침예약 writes — and with the preset on the other one, setting a sleep timer in the app left
     * *two* countdowns running against the same appliance, which is what it looked like on the
